### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Akira Tanaka
#### I specialize in quantum computing. My work involves researching and developing new algorithms based on quantum mechanics. I am actively involved in projects related to quantum cryptography and quantum modeling.
My research in quantum computing focuses on creating new algorithms that can solve complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. I am also working on applying quantum computing in the financial sector, including the development of quantum algorithms for cryptocurrency market analysis and price forecasting.

Additionally, I am involved in developing new methods of quantum encryption that ensure secure data transmission over networks. My goal is to create technologies that help protect the confidentiality and security of information in the digital world.

My work requires deep knowledge in the fields of quantum physics, mathematics, and computer science, and I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas.

Skills: MATLAB / Python / Microsoft Azure Quantum Development Kit / Rigetti Forest / Google Cirq / IBM Quantum Experience / Quantum Development Kit
